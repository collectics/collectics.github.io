# collectics.github.io
It's a website about myself. Not me, but the other me. No, I'm not talking about *Caspian.* I'm not talking about *Domingo* either. Nor *Deion Sanders*.
No, it is I, Collectics, a guy you don't care about! You still won't care about me when you finish going through this website. Trust me.

# An outline of the website
- Homepage: a brief overview about me and a list of who I am.
- Navbar: It's responsive! Kind of.
- About Me: Nothing really special here, it's just some info about me. yay?
- Projects: A table of all my projects that could potentially be on a resume in several years.
- A Nice Meme: i really don't know anymore this website is just stupid.

All requirements in accordance with the guidelines for Project 0 -- https://docs.cs50.net/web/2018/w/projects/0/project0.html -- of this course are satisfied.
