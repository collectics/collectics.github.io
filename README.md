# collectics.github.io
It's a nice meme!

My first *real* website will be a website about myself. I hope it will be functional.
It's also kind of a project for Harvard's CS50 Web Development Course...
...
Kind of.

if I manage to get it working, it'll be up at collectics.github.io because I'm too cheap to purchase a real domain
